            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cup Maida</li>
                <li>¼ Teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>¼ Teaspoon Sugar</li>
                <li>⅛ Teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Dahi or Curd</li>
                <li>2 Teaspoon Semolina or Sooji</li>
                <li>⅓ Cup Water plus 2 teaspoons, approximately</li>
                <li>Oil for Brushing On Top & Frying</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Combine maida, sugar, salt, baking soda, sooji in a bowl and mix to combine. Add curd and mix.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add water little by little and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and soft, which should
                        take around 5 to 10 minutes. Stretch and whack the dough onto the counter for about a minute.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once the dough has reached the desired consistency, gather it into a compact ball. Take a few
                        drops of oil in your palm and rub it over the ball of dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and
                        leave it to rest in a warm place for 15-30 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Knead the dough once again and roll it into a log. Pinch the top bit of the log to divide the
                        dough into 8 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Cover with the same cloth and
                        rest for 10-15 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Rub a little bit of oil (1-2 drops) over the dough balls. This will prevent it from sticking to
                        the counter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Roll each ball into a disc with a diameter of 4-5 inches. Do not use flour to roll the dough as
                        this will stick to the bhaturas even after frying.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To fry the bhaturas, heat oil in a pan or kadai on medium heat until it is very hot.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Carefully drop the rolled out bhatura dough in the hot oil. Use a skimmer to press it down and
                        flip it. This will make it fluff up. Turn and fry until golden brown.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once done, remove the bhatura from the oil and drain them on kitchen paper napkins to remove any
                        excess oil.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Repeat this process for each bhatura. Finally, serve the hot bhaturas with chole masala, along
                        with wedges of lemon and sliced onions.</p>

                        <p>Place this in a pressure cooker along with soaked and drained chole and 3 cups of water.
                            Pressure cook the chole. After the first whistle on high flame, reduce the flame and cook
                            for 25 minutes till the chhole are soft.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once the chole is cooked, remove the potli and discard. Drain the chhole and reserve the
                            water and chickpeas separately.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In an iron kadhai or cast iron pan, roast anardana on a low flame for a few minutes. Then add
                            the cooked chhole, rock salt, ajwain, hing, half the ginger, two slit green chillies and
                            chhole masala. Mix this well. Add ½ cup of reserved chhole water and let this cook on low
                            flame for 7-8 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Keep adding water little by little (approx 2-3 times) and cook the chhole on low for 15-20
                            minutes till the masala coats the chhole well, and the dark colour of the dish deepens.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>In another pan, heat all the ghee and add the remaining ginger and two more slit green
                            chillies. Fry the ginger and chillies and then pour all the ghee on top of the chhole. Mix
                            well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</p>
